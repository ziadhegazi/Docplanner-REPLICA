This is a project i have made in attempt to replicate the Docplanner Group website using HTML and CSS

I tried my best to make it look like an exact replica by just using just those two languages, and improvised in 
what I couldn't exactly replicate.

the link to the real website : https://www.docplanner.com/about-us

The pictures in the photos folder show the comparison between the real website and the replicated one.
